$1000 bounty for implementing Azure AKS support for sifnode 
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Saurav, I hope all is well on your side. I have implemented AKS support for Sifnode and would love to know if the $1000 bounty is still up for grabs.

I decided to create a pull request to this repo because I was not able to reach out to you on Github. I know you must be busy and I apologize for any disturbance.

My pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/Sifchain/sifnode/pull/1603) and my Github handle is [@stevo1403](https://github.com/stevo1403).

Thanks in advance.

Yours Sincerely,
Stephen.
